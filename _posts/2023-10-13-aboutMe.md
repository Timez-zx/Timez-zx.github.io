<h4> I'am Xiao, a 3rd year M.S. student at SJTU (Shanghai Jiao Tong University) advised by <a href="https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~shizhenzhao/">Prof. Shizhen Zhao</a>. Besides, I am also fortunate to be advised by 
<a href="https://vincen.tl">Prof. Vincent Liu</a> as a visiting student and work closely with <a href="https://liangchengyu.com/">Liangcheng Yu</a>. Prior to my M.S. experiences, I received my B.S. degree at SJTU.</h4>

<h4>My research interests focus on systems, networking and programmable hardware like FPGA. For the system, the simple yet effective designs, along with solid implementations fascinate me. At the same time, I am drawn to the seamless integration of theory and practice in the network like most designs in the distributed system. In addition, the flexibility and transparency of programmable devices also provide me with a lot of room for imagination. I am attempting to find a balance and preference among these three aspects.</h4>
