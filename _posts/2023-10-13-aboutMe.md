<h4> I'am Xiao, a 1st year Phd student at UT Austin, working together with <a href="https://daehyeok.kim/">Daehyeok Kim</a> at <a href="https://utns.cs.utexas.edu/">UTNS</a>. Besides, I am also fortunate to work closely with <a href="https://liangchengyu.com/">Liangcheng Yu</a> as a visiting student at UPenn. Prior to my Phd experiences, I received my M.S. and B.S. degree at SJTU.</h4>

<h4>My research interests focus on networkd systems. I am fascinated by the simple but effective designs in networked systems and the creative potential of programmable devices.</h4>
