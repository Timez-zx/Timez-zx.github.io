<h4> I'am Xiao, a 3rd year M.S. student at SJTU (Shanghai Jiao Tong University) advised by <a href="https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~shizhenzhao/">Prof. Shizhen Zhao</a>. Besides, I am also fortunate to be advised by 
<a href="https://vincen.tl">Prof. Vincent Liu</a> as a visiting student and work closely with <a href="https://liangchengyu.com/">Liangcheng Yu</a>. Prior to my M.S. experiences, I received my B.S. degree at SJTU.</h4>

<h4>My research interests focus on networkd systems, especially for programmable devices like FPGA. I am fascinated by the simple but effective designs in networked systems and the creative potential of programmable devices.</h4>
